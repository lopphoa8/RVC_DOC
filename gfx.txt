Examine the dynamic processes linking attitudes and actions and the role that attitude strength plays 
in moderating these processes / interested in 2 key stages of a continuous sequence: 

The influence of an initial attitude on the performance of a subsequent behavior.
The effect of feedback resulting from the performance of that behavior in changing the initial attitude.

Attitude strength should moderate both of these stages 

1st, strong attitudes should be more likely to lead to attitude-consistent actions.
2nd, strong attitudes should be more resistant to change in the face of feedback following the performance of the behavior.
